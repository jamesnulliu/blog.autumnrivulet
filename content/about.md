Hello, I am JamesNULLiu.

I am a third-year undergraduate student at the [School of Computer Engineering and Science](https://cs.shu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/), currently engaged in **computer vision** and **machine learning** research under the guidance of [Prof. Hang Yu](). As the principal maintainer of [SHUSCT](https://github.com/SHUSCT) and a contributor to [SHUOSC](https://github.com/shuosc), my programming expertise encompasses **C++**, **Python**, and **CUDA**. 

I possess proficient skills in building cross-platform applications using **CMake**, and I am adept at designing and implementing deep learning models with both **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**. My experience also extends to **operating and maintaining high-performance computing clusters**, **optimizing complex computing tasks**, and **performance tuning**.

I am passionate about learning and sharing knowledge, and I am always open to new opportunities and challenges. If you have any inquiries or are interested in collaboration, please feel free to contact me via email at jamesnulliu@gmail.com.
