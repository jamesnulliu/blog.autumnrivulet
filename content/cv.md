Hello, I am JamesNULLiu (Yanchen Liu, ÂàòÂΩ¶Ëæ∞).

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the [School of Computer Engineering and Science](https://cs.shu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/), now working as an intern in [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn), mainly engaged in inference acceleration and graph optimization of large language models.

As the principal maintainer of [SHUSCT](https://github.com/SHUSCT) and a contributor to [SHUOSC](https://github.com/shuosc), my programming expertise encompasses **C++**, **Python**, **CUDA** and **MLIR**. I also possess proficient skills in building cross-platform applications and libraries using **CMake**, and I am adept at designing and implementing deep learning models with **PyTorch**. My experience also extends to **operating and maintaining high-performance computing clusters**, **optimizing complex computing tasks**, and **performance tuning**.

I am passionate about learning and sharing knowledge, and I am always open to new opportunities and challenges. If you have any inquiries or are interested in collaboration, please feel free to contact me via email at jamesnulliu@gmail.com.
